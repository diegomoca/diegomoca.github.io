# AI video workshop
steps 5-9 are meant to be done simultaneously to make the best use of our time considering that the generation of each clip takes a couple of minutes.
# step 1 thematic development
for this step we are going to pick a topic for our video, then we're going to explore different points surrounding it and try to make connections between them to then be able to create a timeline with a logical succession of events. were are also going to use assistance of different tools like chatbots and online translators for the generation and improvement of text.
# step 2 timeline development
for this step we're going to explore different methods of visual storytelling including non-narrative footage. then, using the material from the previous step, we're going to plan a 1-1.5 minutes timeline divided in a number of scenes subdivided in different clips. we're going to be very specific about the length of the scenes and we're going to take into consideration the limitations of the programs to generate long clips.
# step 3 speech writing
for this step we will explore different types of speech, and then we're going to write a text to go alongside our footage as audio. we're going to take into account our previously developed timeline and reinforce our story through spoken words. again, we'll use assistance of tools like chatbots and translators for the improvement of our texts.
# step 4 prompt writing
for this step we we'll start writing down prompts to generate our clips. we'll explore different techniques to achieve the best possible results in the least amount of attempts. we'll also learn about the level of detail that we can use to generate clips and the amount of information we can transmit with the clip length limitations.
# step 5 clip generation*
for this step we will start inserting our previously written prompts into an AI video generation service like Hailou. then we'll download these videos and organize them in a folder system that will make sense for our project, and that will make the finding of this clips easy and intuitive. we will prioritize clips requiring extension and lip syncing so that we can work on those time consuming aspects while we generate the rest of the clips. we will also learn to extract the last frame of a clip using tools like DaVinci and Inkscape to extend them using image to video generation.
# step 6 music generation*
for this step we will learn about different music genres and instrumentations. we'll also learn about how the music and sounds we use in a film can completely change the emotions and message it transmits. then we will combine all this knowledge to generate a piece of music appropriate for our film.
# step 7 speech generation*
for this step we will insert our previously generated speech into a text to speech service like Elevenlabs. we will explore different voice models, and how each of them are more suitable for certain application than others. we will also try to find vocal models matching the characters generated in our clips and take into consideration the limitations of Elevenlabs free plan.
# step 8 video editing*
for this step we will start inserting our previously generated clips into a video editing software like DaVinci. we will create a main project for the final film and we will also create sub-projects for individual scenes the require extra editing. then we will insert the music and speech and we will learn to adjust the levels of the different audio files, and to make them stereo.
# step 9 lip syncing*
for this step we will learn to export sections of a film with DaVinci, and we'll extract the clips that require lip syncing and combine it with our previously generated speeches using a service like Kling. we will also learn about topics like media literacy and how we need to be aware of new technologies that can be used for malicious media manipulation.
# step 10 quality control
by the beginning of this step, we should already have a first draft of our video in our DaVinci timeline. We will now evaluate the quality of our product by looking for artifacts and mistakes common in AI generated images, like inconsistencies in our characters hands, or objects transforming into other objects. we can also learn to use such inconsistencies to our advantage in creative ways. we will asses which clips need to be regenerated, and in this process will learn to give priority to the most important parts of the project, or the parts that need extra work, while managing to have a final result on time.
# step 11 final draft
for our final step we will give the final touches to our video and we will learn to render it into a file that can be shared with everyone.
